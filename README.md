# Linear Programming

The code here was primarily written for my Operations Research class. The path following algorithm implementation is based
on the one presented in Chapter 8 of Linear Programming with MATLAB (Ferris et al., 2007). The interior point algorithms are
based on Dr. Lesaja's (2009) paper.
